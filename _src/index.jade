					p Hi, I'm Stuart. I'm a web developer currently living and working in Edinburgh. I work with PHP, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 & #[a(href="#skills") other technologies] to produce reponsive, well structured and secure web applications.
				.content
					p My skills are all self-taught. I've been working professionally as a developer for about a year, and learning for at least five years in my spare time. The first website I can remember making was a #[span.proper-title Chrono Trigger] fan site when I was 12. Sadly, it's no longer online. My other interests include photography, cooking &amp; #[span#bd d]ad jokes.
